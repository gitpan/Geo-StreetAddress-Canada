NAME
    Geo::StreetAddress::Canada - Perl extension for parsing Canadian street addresses

DESCRIPTION
	Geo::StreetAddress::Canada is a regex-based street address and street intersection
	parser for Canada. Its basic goal is to be as forgiving as possible
	when parsing user-provided address strings. Geo::StreetAddress::Canada knows about
	directional prefixes and suffixes, fractional building numbers, building units,
	grid-based addresses, postal codes, and all of the official Canada Post abbreviations 
	for street types, province names and secondary unit designators. Please note that this
	extension will only return data in English. If you are looking for French language support,
	Please see Geo::StreetAddress::FR. Patches are welcome if someone wishes to combine the two!
